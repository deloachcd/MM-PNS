* My Musical P-NAS (MM-PNS)
My Musical P-NAS is my personal solution for hosting a NAS that also streams music on a
Raspberry Pi. Setup is largely automated through Ansible, and services are deployed within
a set of containers which can be easily spun up and down with ~docker-compose~.

** Requirements
- A raspberry pi with reasonable specs running raspbian
- A valid SSL cert for the HTTPS reverse proxied services
- A working SSH connection to the raspberry pi with public key authentication
- Ansible on the machine the provisioning playbooks will be run from
  
** Feature Roadmap
- [ ] Automated firewall provisioning for public-facing web service, LAN-only samba and SSH services
- [ ] Automated setup of containerized [[https://www.navidrome.org/][Navidrome]] service behind HTTPS reverse proxy
- [ ] Automated setup of containerized [[https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser][filebrowser]] service behind HTTPS reverse proxy
- [ ] Automated setup of containerized samba service
